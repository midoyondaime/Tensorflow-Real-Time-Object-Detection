## Setup 

### Dependencies

1. [TensorFlow](www.tensorflow.org)
2. [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
3. [lmxl](http://lxml.de/)
4. [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)


### Installation

To begin, Make sure you have all of the dependencies. 

You can install the dependencies by running the following commands from the terminal.

```python
pip install tensorflow
pip install pillow
pip install lxml
pip install jupyter
```

Next, you need to clone the github. You can do this with git, or you can just download the repository to .zip:

`git clone https://github.com/u-prashant/Tensorflow-Real-Time-Object-Detection.git` OR click the green "clone or download" button on the https://github.com/u-prashant/Tensorflow-Real-Time-Object-Detection page, download the .zip, and extract it.

### Getting started

After installation, you can either run the IPython notebook *(Webcam.ipynb)* or the python file *(Webcam.py)*.


## Usage

To run the code, go to the ![directory](https://github.com/u-prashant/Tensorflow-Real-Time-Object-Detection/tree/master/models/object_detection), and <br/>
Open `webcam.ipynb` in jupyter notebook. <br/>
Or <br/>
Open `webcam.py` in terminal
